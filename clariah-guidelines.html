    <p class="lead">
      This document contains actionable steps that will make your software more
      usable and discoverable for users and other developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is divided in two sections. The first section contains the
      minimal requirements that your software should adhere to. It should not take
      a lot of time to implement them and many of them will already have been
      implemented without thinking. If you're writing experimental software then
      you can omit some.
    </p>
    The second section contains more generic guidelines that can help you achieve software of a higher quality. The requirements in section 1 frequently refer to the guidelines they are based on.
    <p>

    <p>
      The requirements are specified in a form that leaves little room for
      discussion. They are but one way of meeting the more generic guidelines.
      We do encourage you to follow them as-is. Doing so will make implementing
      them easier for you. It will also make consuming the results easier for
      your peers as they can rely on a firm structure.
    </p>

    <p>
 The guidelines on the other hand are <emph>not</emph> simple boxes to tick. Instead they offer you ways to look at quality in software and tips on making your software better and more useful. They guidelines are phrased as open questions that you can answer to explain to other people the trade-offs that you made while developing.
</p>

    <h2>1. Requirements</h2>
    <p>
    This section contains a set of guidelines that you can simply implement. They
    follow common practice where possible and take a firm choice where
    interoperability benefits from one. However, depending on the context, your peers will expect more or less from you.

    <!--//FIXME write in shorthand, you can expand sections by clicking on them
    //FIXME add examples/templates for all requirements-->
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Not all software is intended to be used by end-users. Some software is written to be used only by people who can modify the code. This makes the software less usable, but when the goal of the project is to verify if something is at all possible this might be a valid trade-off.</li> 

    <li>While everyone wants the software they use to receive active support, this is in practice not always feasible. It is okay to release unsupported software, but users should be notified clearly and upfront about this fact.</li>
    </ul>
    <span class="hidden noscript"> For experimental software you may ignore all guidelines starting with [prod] but must adhere to the guidelines starting with [exp]. For production software the opposite applies. For unsupported software you may ignore the guidelines starting with [supp] but must adhere to the guidelines starting with [unsupp]. For supported software the opposite applies.</span>

# [Project name]

WARNING: this is experimental software that should only be used by people willing to read and understand the code

NOTE: this software will receive active support at least until the 7th of june 2016, and probably therafter as well.

## Introduction

This software is aimed at historians doing interpretative research. This means that they collect facts from various documents, interpret and structure them, and create a structured dataset of these facts. This dataset is then used to create new insight.

These historians often need to categorize their findings. For example they need to name the birthplace of a person. A placename is not always clearcut. Do we use the name of the city, or the burrough? Do we use the current name or the name when the person was born? Historians often spend a lot of time creating datasets to solve this problem. For example a list of places and names throughout time, or data about period names linked to a location and time (such as "world war II in the Netherlands was from 1940 to 1945"). 

Sharing these lists between researchers, creating a new dataset based on such a list, and keeping tracks of updates to the lost is not trivial and currently prohibitively so.

This software allows researchers to create datasets and interlink them. One researcher might make a dataset that lists places throughout time

<h2>2. Guidelines</h2>
<p> hier volgt vooral mijn mening over de guidelines die niet hierboven opgenomen zijn</p>

<p>De volgende items moeten denk ik nog wat uitgewerkt worden en concreter worden. Nu zou ik niet weten hoe ik software kan schrijven die eraan voldoet.</p>
<ul>
<li>D4</li>
<li>PF1</li>
<li>PF2</li>
<li>PF3</li>
<li>CH1</li>
</ul>

<p>De volgende items zijn fijne tips. Best concreet. Wellicht kunnen we ze nog wat meer body geven.</p>
<ul>
<li>D3 (use step by step and task oriented instructions)</li>
<li>D8 use examples</li>
<li>D9 have each question and bug end up in the documentation</li>
<li>PF4 als we linken naar de uitleg van google over 60fps</li>
<li>AC3</li>
<li>AC5</li>
<li>AC6</li>
<li>AC7</li>
<li>TS1 (note on coverage)</li>
<li>SP2</li>
<li>SP3 + gitter/IRC/slack</li>
<li>AN1</li>
<li>AN2</li>
<li>AN3</li>
<li>AN4</li>
<li>AN5</li>
<li>AN6</li>
<li>AN7</li>
<li>AN8</li>
<li>CH4</li>
<li>CH5</li>
<li>R1</li>
<li>R2</li>
<li>R3</li>
<li>SC1 (voeg owasp toe)</li>
<li>how to create a screenshot/screencast</li>
</ul>

<p>De volgende items zijn mooie algemene guidelines die mensen in het achterhoofd kunnen houden. Het zou goed zijn om te verwijzen naar literatuur over hoe je dit implementeert omdat het goed volgen van de guidelines soms een carriere aan ervaring behoeft.</p>
