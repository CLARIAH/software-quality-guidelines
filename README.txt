This repository contains guidelines for software quality & sustainability for
CLARIAH. It has been composed as a part of WP2 task 54.100. Please access the
PDF document in this repository to read it.

The document came about in response to the need for increasing attention to
software quality and sustainability in the academic world, as software is such
an essential component of our research, yet good software development practice
is often not adhered to in a satisfactory degree, and sustainability is often
problematic. The guidelines are an instrument for both for the developers of software, as
well as software adopters, to assess the quality and sustainability of software

The guidelines are currently in a proposal stage in which we would very much like
to get some input. Please see the Request for Comment section at the end of the PDF.
